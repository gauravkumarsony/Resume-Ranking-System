# **Resume Screening and Ranking System** 🎯📄  

This **AI-powered Resume Screening and Ranking System** helps recruiters and hiring managers efficiently evaluate resumes against job descriptions using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques. The system analyzes resumes, calculates similarity scores, and ranks candidates based on their relevance to the job requirements.  

### **🚀 Features**  
✅ **Job Description Input** – Paste or type the job description.  
✅ **Resume Upload** – Supports multiple PDF resume uploads.  
✅ **AI-Powered Scoring** – Uses **Cosine Similarity & Bag-of-Words (BoW)** to rank resumes.  
✅ **Key Skills Extraction** – Identifies relevant skills from resumes.  
✅ **Interactive UI** – Built with **Streamlit**, offering a smooth user experience.  
✅ **Dark & Light Mode** – Toggle between themes with a Sun/Moon button.  

### **🛠️ Tech Stack**  
- **Frontend & UI:** Streamlit  
- **Backend & Logic:** Python, NLP (NLTK), Machine Learning (Scikit-Learn)  
- **Model Used:** **CountVectorizer + Cosine Similarity**  
- **File Handling:** PyPDF2 for extracting text from resumes  

### **📌 How It Works?**  
1️⃣ Enter a job description.  
2️⃣ Upload one or multiple PDF resumes.  
3️⃣ The system preprocesses text, removes stopwords, and computes similarity.  
4️⃣ Resumes are ranked based on their match scores.  
5️⃣ Displays key skills extracted from resumes.  

### **🔮 Future Enhancements**  
- Support for **more resume formats** (Docx, JSON, etc.)  
- Integration with **GPT-based models** for advanced ranking  
- Enhanced **keyword weighting** for better accuracy  
- Improved **resume parsing** using AI-based methods
